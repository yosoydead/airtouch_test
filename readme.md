* This was made from scratch
* Technologies used:
    1. kotlin coroutines for doing background operations
    2. android view model
    3. android live data
    4. android navigation components
    5. card view to create the layout for each item
    6. recycler view to display the list of items
    7. predefined android/jvm libraries
* No 3rd party frameworks were used
* Tried to use the MVVM architecture
* Used a repository for communication between the viewmodel and the service which provides data
* What this app doesn't have:
    * local database/access to cloud database
    * pretty UI
    * fancy animations
    * unit tests
